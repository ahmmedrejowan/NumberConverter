      "content": "A number system is a way of representing numbers using a specific set of symbols or digits. Just like we use different languages to communicate, we use different number systems for different purposes.\n\nThe most common number system we use every day is the decimal system (base 10), which uses digits 0 through 9. But did you know that computers use a completely different system called binary (base 2)?\n\nEach number system has a 'base' which tells us how many unique digits are available:\n\u2022 Decimal (base 10): uses 10 digits (0-9)\n\u2022 Binary (base 2): uses 2 digits (0, 1)\n\u2022 Octal (base 8): uses 8 digits (0-7)\n\u2022 Hexadecimal (base 16): uses 16 digits (0-9, A-F)\n\nWhy do we need different number systems? Computers work with electrical signals that are either ON or OFF, making binary perfect for them. Hexadecimal is great for programmers because it's shorter than binary but still easy to convert."
