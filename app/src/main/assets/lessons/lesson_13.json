      "title": "Converting Decimal to Octal",
      "content": "Converting decimal to octal uses the division method, just like decimal to binary or hex, but we divide by 8!\n\n**Division by 8 Method:**\n\n1. Divide the decimal number by 8\n2. Write down the remainder (0-7)\n3. Divide the quotient by 8\n4. Repeat until quotient is 0\n5. Read remainders from BOTTOM to TOP\n\n**Example 1: Convert 156 to octal**\n\n156 \u00f7 8 = 19 remainder 4\n19 \u00f7 8 = 2 remainder 3\n2 \u00f7 8 = 0 remainder 2\n\nReading bottom to top: 234\nSo 156 in decimal = 234 in octal!\n\nVerify: 2\u00d764 + 3\u00d78 + 4\u00d71 = 128 + 24 + 4 = 156 \u2713\n\n**Example 2: Convert 100 to octal**\n\n100 \u00f7 8 = 12 remainder 4\n12 \u00f7 8 = 1 remainder 4\n1 \u00f7 8 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading bottom to top: 144\nSo 100 in decimal = 144 in octal!\n\n**Example 3: Convert 64 to octal**\n\n64 \u00f7 8 = 8 remainder 0\n8 \u00f7 8 = 1 remainder 0\n1 \u00f7 8 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading bottom to top: 100\nSo 64 in decimal = 100 in octal! (Makes sense: 64 = 8\u00b2)\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n\u2022 All remainders will be 0-7 (valid octal digits)\n\u2022 Powers of 8 are easy: 8 = 10, 64 = 100, 512 = 1000\n\u2022 Remember to read from BOTTOM to TOP!"
