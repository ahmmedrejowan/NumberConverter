      "content": "There are two popular methods to convert decimal to binary. Let's learn both!\n\n**Method 1: Division by 2 (Easier for most people)**\n\n1. Divide the decimal number by 2\n2. Write down the remainder (0 or 1)\n3. Divide the quotient by 2 again\n4. Repeat until quotient is 0\n5. Read remainders from BOTTOM to TOP\n\nExample: Convert 13 to binary\n13 \u00f7 2 = 6 remainder 1\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3 remainder 0\n3 \u00f7 2 = 1 remainder 1\n1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading bottom to top: 1101\nSo 13 in decimal = 1101 in binary!\n\n**Method 2: Subtraction (Faster for small numbers)**\n\n1. Find the largest power of 2 that fits in your number\n2. Subtract it and put a 1 in that position\n3. Repeat for the remainder\n4. Put 0 in positions you skip\n\nExample: Convert 25 to binary\n\u2022 Largest power of 2 \u2264 25 is 16, so: 25 - 16 = 9, put 1 in 16s place\n\u2022 Largest power of 2 \u2264 9 is 8, so: 9 - 8 = 1, put 1 in 8s place\n\u2022 Skip 4 and 2 (too large), put 0s\n\u2022 1 fits exactly, put 1 in 1s place\n\nResult: 11001 (positions: 16 8 4 2 1)\n\nBoth methods work! Choose whichever makes more sense to you."
