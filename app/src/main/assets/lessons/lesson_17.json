      "content": "Converting decimal fractions to binary uses a different method than whole numbers. We use the **multiply by 2** method!\n\n**Multiply by 2 Method:**\n\n1. Take the fractional part only\n2. Multiply by 2\n3. Write down the integer part (0 or 1)\n4. Keep the fractional remainder\n5. Repeat until remainder is 0 or desired precision\n6. Read the integer parts from TOP to BOTTOM\n\n**Example 1: Convert 0.625 to binary**\n\n0.625 \u00d7 2 = 1.25 \u2192 integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.25\n0.25 \u00d7 2 = 0.5 \u2192 integer part: **0**, remainder: 0.5\n0.5 \u00d7 2 = 1.0 \u2192 integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.0\n\nReading top to bottom: 0.101\nSo 0.625 in decimal = 0.101 in binary!\n\n**Example 2: Convert 0.75 to binary**\n\n0.75 \u00d7 2 = 1.5 \u2192 integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.5\n0.5 \u00d7 2 = 1.0 \u2192 integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.0\n\nResult: 0.11\nSo 0.75 in decimal = 0.11 in binary!\n\n**Example 3: Convert 2.75 to binary**\n\nHandle separately:\nWhole part: 2 = 10 (binary)\nFractional: 0.75 = 0.11 (binary)\nCombined: 10.11\n\n**Example 4: 0.1 (repeating binary)**\n\n0.1 \u00d7 2 = 0.2 \u2192 **0**, remainder: 0.2\n0.2 \u00d7 2 = 0.4 \u2192 **0**, remainder: 0.4\n0.4 \u00d7 2 = 0.8 \u2192 **0**, remainder: 0.8\n0.8 \u00d7 2 = 1.6 \u2192 **1**, remainder: 0.6\n0.6 \u00d7 2 = 1.2 \u2192 **1**, remainder: 0.2 (repeats!)\n\nResult: 0.00011001100... (infinite)\nThis is why 0.1 can't be exact in binary!\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n\u2022 Convert whole and fractional parts separately\n\u2022 Read bits from TOP to BOTTOM (opposite of whole number conversion!)\n\u2022 Stop when remainder is 0 or at desired precision\n\u2022 Some fractions will repeat infinitely"
