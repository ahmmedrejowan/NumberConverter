      "content": "There's no direct conversion between octal and hex! But we can use binary as a bridge since both have clean relationships with binary.\n\n**The Binary Bridge Method:**\n\nOctal \u2192 Binary \u2192 Hex\n\u2022 Octal to Binary: each octal digit = 3 bits\n\u2022 Binary to Hex: group 4 bits = 1 hex digit\n\u2022 May need to regroup bits!\n\nHex \u2192 Binary \u2192 Octal\n\u2022 Hex to Binary: each hex digit = 4 bits\n\u2022 Binary to Octal: group 3 bits = 1 octal digit\n\u2022 May need to regroup bits!\n\n**Example 1: Convert octal 157 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Octal to Binary (3 bits each)\n\u2022 1 = 001\n\u2022 5 = 101\n\u2022 7 = 111\nBinary: 001 101 111\n\nStep 2: Regroup for Hex (4 bits each)\nFrom right: 0 0110 1111\nPad: 0000 0110 1111\n\nStep 3: Binary to Hex\n\u2022 0000 = 0\n\u2022 0110 = 6\n\u2022 1111 = F\nResult: 6F\n\nSo octal 157 = hex 6F!\n\n**Example 2: Convert hex 2F to octal**\n\nStep 1: Hex to Binary (4 bits each)\n\u2022 2 = 0010\n\u2022 F = 1111\nBinary: 0010 1111\n\nStep 2: Regroup for Octal (3 bits each)\nFrom right: 010 111 1\nPad: 010 111 001 (wait, from right: 001 011 111)\nCorrect grouping: 000 101 111\n\nStep 3: Binary to Octal\n\u2022 000 = 0\n\u2022 101 = 5\n\u2022 111 = 7\nResult: 057 (or just 57)\n\nSo hex 2F = octal 57!\n\n**Why No Direct Method?**\n\u2022 Octal uses 3-bit groups (base 8)\n\u2022 Hex uses 4-bit groups (base 16)\n\u2022 3 and 4 don't divide evenly!\n\u2022 Binary is the common language\n\n**When to Use Each:**\n\u2022 **Hex**: Modern computing, web colors, memory addresses\n\u2022 **Octal**: Unix permissions, legacy systems\n\u2022 **Binary**: Low-level programming, understanding hardware\n\u2022 **Decimal**: Human-friendly, everyday use\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n\u2022 Always use binary as intermediate step\n\u2022 Be careful with bit grouping (3 vs 4)\n\u2022 Group from RIGHT to LEFT\n\u2022 Hex is more common today than octal"
