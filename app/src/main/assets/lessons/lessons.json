          "content": "A number system is a way of representing numbers using a specific set of symbols or digits. Just like we use different languages to communicate, we use different number systems for different purposes.\n\nThe most common number system we use every day is the decimal system (base 10), which uses digits 0 through 9. But did you know that computers use a completely different system called binary (base 2)?\n\nEach number system has a 'base' which tells us how many unique digits are available:\n• Decimal (base 10): uses 10 digits (0-9)\n• Binary (base 2): uses 2 digits (0, 1)\n• Octal (base 8): uses 8 digits (0-7)\n• Hexadecimal (base 16): uses 16 digits (0-9, A-F)\n\nWhy do we need different number systems? Computers work with electrical signals that are either ON or OFF, making binary perfect for them. Hexadecimal is great for programmers because it's shorter than binary but still easy to convert."

Write down the remainder (0 or 1)\n3. Divide the quotient by 2 again\n4. Repeat until quotient is 0\n5. Read remainders from BOTTOM to TOP\n\nExample: Convert 13 to binary\n13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading bottom to top: 1101\nSo 13 in decimal = 1101 in binary!\n\n**Method 2: Subtraction (Faster for small numbers)**\n\n1. Find the largest power of 2 that fits in your number\n2. Subtract it and put a 1 in that position\n3. Repeat for the remainder\n4. Put 0 in positions you skip\n\nExample: Convert 25 to binary\n• Largest power of 2 ≤ 25 is 16, so: 25 - 16 = 9, put 1 in 16s place\n• Largest power of 2 ≤ 9 is 8, so: 9 - 8 = 1, put 1 in 8s place\n• Skip 4 and 2 (too large), put 0s\n• 1 fits exactly, put 1 in 1s place\n\nResult: 11001 (positions: 16 8 4 2 1)\n\nBoth methods work!

          "content": "Converting hexadecimal to decimal is similar to converting binary to decimal, but we use powers of 16 instead of powers of 2!\n\n**Step-by-Step Method:**\n\n1. Write down the hex number\n2. Write the position values (powers of 16) below each digit\n3. Convert any letter digits to decimal (A=10, B=11, ... F=15)\n4. Multiply each digit by its position value\n5. Add all the results\n\n**Example 1: Convert 2A to decimal**\n\nHex:       2    A\nPositions: 16   1\nValues:    2    10 (A=10)\nCalculate: 2×16 10×1\nResults:   32 + 10 = 42\n\nSo 2A in hex = 42 in decimal!\n\n**Example 2: Convert 1F3 to decimal**\n\nHex:       1    F    3\nPositions: 256  16   1\nValues:    1    15   3\nCalculate: 1×256 15×16 3×1\nResults:   256 + 240 + 3 = 499\n\nSo 1F3 in hex = 499 in decimal!\n\n**Common Hex Values to Remember:**\n• F = 15\n• FF = 255 (very common in colors!)\n• 100 = 256\n• FFF = 4095\n\nRemember: Always convert letter digits (A-F) to their decimal values (10-15) before calculating!"

Start from the RIGHT side of the binary number\n2. Group the bits into sets of 4\n3. If the leftmost group has fewer than 4 bits, add leading zeros\n4. Convert each 4-bit group to its hex digit (0-F)\n5. Combine the hex digits\n\n**Reference Table:**\n0000 = 0    0100 = 4    1000 = 8    1100 = C\n0001 = 1    0101 = 5    1001 = 9    1101 = D\n0010 = 2    0110 = 6    1010 = A    1110 = E\n0011 = 3    0111 = 7    1011 = B    1111 = F\n\n**Example 1: Convert 11010110 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 1101 0110\nStep 2: Convert each group:\n  • 1101 = 13 = D\n  • 0110 = 6 = 6\nResult: D6\n\n**Example 2: Convert 101111 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 10 1111\nStep 2: Pad left group: 0010 1111\nStep 3: Convert:\n  • 0010 = 2\n  • 1111 = 15 = F\nResult: 2F\n\n**Why This Works:**\nEach hex digit (0-F) represents values 0-15, which is exactly what 4 bits can represent (2⁴=16 values)! This makes binary-to-hex conversion super fast - no multiplication needed!\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Always group from RIGHT to LEFT\n• Memorize the 16 conversions (0000-1111 to 0-F)\n• Common patterns: 1111=F, 1010=A, 0000=0"

Take each hex digit one at a time\n2. Convert each digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent\n3. Combine all the 4-bit groups together\n4. Remove unnecessary leading zeros (optional)\n\n**Quick Reference Table:**\n0 = 0000    4 = 0100    8 = 1000    C = 1100\n1 = 0001    5 = 0101    9 = 1001    D = 1101\n2 = 0010    6 = 0110    A = 1010    E = 1110\n3 = 0011    7 = 0111    B = 1011    F = 1111\n\n**Example 1: Convert 3A to binary**\n\nStep 1: Convert each digit:\n  • 3 = 0011\n  • A = 1010\nStep 2: Combine: 0011 1010\nResult: 00111010 (or 111010 if you remove leading zeros)\n\n**Example 2: Convert F5 to binary**\n\nStep 1: Convert:\n  • F = 1111\n  • 5 = 0101\nStep 2: Combine: 1111 0101\nResult: 11110101\n\n**Example 3: Convert 2B8 to binary**\n\nStep 1: Convert each:\n  • 2 = 0010\n  • B = 1011\n  • 8 = 1000\nStep 2: Combine: 0010 1011 1000\nResult: 001010111000 (or 10101110 00 with spacing)\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Each hex digit ALWAYS becomes exactly 4 bits\n• Don't forget leading zeros within each group!\n• For the leftmost hex digit, you can remove leading zeros from the final result\n• Common values: F=1111, A=1010, 0=0000\n\nThis is the fastest number system conversion because it's just a direct substitution!"
