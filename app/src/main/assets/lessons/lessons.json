          "content": "A number system is a way of representing numbers using a specific set of symbols or digits. Just like we use different languages to communicate, we use different number systems for different purposes.\n\nThe most common number system we use every day is the decimal system (base 10), which uses digits 0 through 9. But did you know that computers use a completely different system called binary (base 2)?\n\nEach number system has a 'base' which tells us how many unique digits are available:\n• Decimal (base 10): uses 10 digits (0-9)\n• Binary (base 2): uses 2 digits (0, 1)\n• Octal (base 8): uses 8 digits (0-7)\n• Hexadecimal (base 16): uses 16 digits (0-9, A-F)\n\nWhy do we need different number systems? Computers work with electrical signals that are either ON or OFF, making binary perfect for them. Hexadecimal is great for programmers because it's shorter than binary but still easy to convert."

Write down the remainder (0 or 1)\n3. Divide the quotient by 2 again\n4. Repeat until quotient is 0\n5. Read remainders from BOTTOM to TOP\n\nExample: Convert 13 to binary\n13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading bottom to top: 1101\nSo 13 in decimal = 1101 in binary!\n\n**Method 2: Subtraction (Faster for small numbers)**\n\n1. Find the largest power of 2 that fits in your number\n2. Subtract it and put a 1 in that position\n3. Repeat for the remainder\n4. Put 0 in positions you skip\n\nExample: Convert 25 to binary\n• Largest power of 2 ≤ 25 is 16, so: 25 - 16 = 9, put 1 in 16s place\n• Largest power of 2 ≤ 9 is 8, so: 9 - 8 = 1, put 1 in 8s place\n• Skip 4 and 2 (too large), put 0s\n• 1 fits exactly, put 1 in 1s place\n\nResult: 11001 (positions: 16 8 4 2 1)\n\nBoth methods work!

Write down the hex number\n2. Write the position values (powers of 16) below each digit\n3. Convert any letter digits to decimal (A=10, B=11, ... F=15)\n4. Multiply each digit by its position value\n5. Add all the results\n\n**Example 1: Convert 2A to decimal**\n\nHex:       2    A\nPositions: 16   1\nValues:    2    10 (A=10)\nCalculate: 2×16 10×1\nResults:   32 + 10 = 42\n\nSo 2A in hex = 42 in decimal!\n\n**Example 2: Convert 1F3 to decimal**\n\nHex:       1    F    3\nPositions: 256  16   1\nValues:    1    15   3\nCalculate: 1×256 15×16 3×1\nResults:   256 + 240 + 3 = 499\n\nSo 1F3 in hex = 499 in decimal!\n\n**Common Hex Values to Remember:**\n• F = 15\n• FF = 255 (very common in colors!)\n• 100 = 256\n• FFF = 4095\n\nRemember: Always convert letter digits (A-F) to their decimal values (10-15) before calculating!"

Start from the RIGHT side of the binary number\n2. Group the bits into sets of 4\n3. If the leftmost group has fewer than 4 bits, add leading zeros\n4. Convert each 4-bit group to its hex digit (0-F)\n5. Combine the hex digits\n\n**Reference Table:**\n0000 = 0    0100 = 4    1000 = 8    1100 = C\n0001 = 1    0101 = 5    1001 = 9    1101 = D\n0010 = 2    0110 = 6    1010 = A    1110 = E\n0011 = 3    0111 = 7    1011 = B    1111 = F\n\n**Example 1: Convert 11010110 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 1101 0110\nStep 2: Convert each group:\n  • 1101 = 13 = D\n  • 0110 = 6 = 6\nResult: D6\n\n**Example 2: Convert 101111 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 10 1111\nStep 2: Pad left group: 0010 1111\nStep 3: Convert:\n  • 0010 = 2\n  • 1111 = 15 = F\nResult: 2F\n\n**Why This Works:**\nEach hex digit (0-F) represents values 0-15, which is exactly what 4 bits can represent (2⁴=16 values)! This makes binary-to-hex conversion super fast - no multiplication needed!\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Always group from RIGHT to LEFT\n• Memorize the 16 conversions (0000-1111 to 0-F)\n• Common patterns: 1111=F, 1010=A, 0000=0"

Before hexadecimal became popular, octal was commonly used in early computing because it has a clean relationship with binary: each octal digit represents exactly 3 binary bits.\n\n**Place values in octal use powers of 8:**\n• 8⁰ = 1 (ones place)\n• 8¹ = 8 (eights place)\n• 8² = 64 (sixty-fours place)\n• 8³ = 512 (five-hundred-twelves place)\n\n**Where is octal still used today?**\n• **Unix/Linux file permissions**: chmod 755 (rwxr-xr-x)\n• **Legacy systems**: Some older computer systems\n• **Educational purposes**: Learning number systems\n\n**Binary-to-Octal Relationship:**\nEach octal digit = 3 binary bits\n• 0 = 000\n• 1 = 001\n• 2 = 010\n• 3 = 011\n• 4 = 100\n• 5 = 101\n• 6 = 110\n• 7 = 111\n\n**Example: What is 25 in octal?**\n2 is in the 8s place: 2 × 8 = 16\n5 is in the 1s place: 5 × 1 = 5\nTotal: 16 + 5 = 21 in decimal\n\nOctal is less common than hexadecimal today, but understanding it helps you master number systems and is essential for working with Unix permissions!"

Convert each 3-bit group to its octal digit (0-7)\n5. Combine the octal digits\n\n**Reference Table:**\n000 = 0    010 = 2    100 = 4    110 = 6\n001 = 1    011 = 3    101 = 5    111 = 7\n\n**Example 1: Convert 110101 to octal**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 110 101\nStep 2: Convert each group:\n  • 110 = 6\n  • 101 = 5\nResult: 65\n\n**Example 2: Convert 11010110 to octal**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 11 010 110\nStep 2: Pad left group: 011 010 110\nStep 3: Convert:\n  • 011 = 3\n  • 010 = 2\n  • 110 = 6\nResult: 326\n\n**Example 3: Convert 1111111 to octal**\n\nStep 1: Group from right: 1 111 111\nStep 2: Pad left: 001 111 111\nStep 3: Convert:\n  • 001 = 1\n  • 111 = 7\n  • 111 = 7\nResult: 177\n\n**Why This Works:**\nEach octal digit (0-7) represents values 0-7, which is exactly what 3 bits can represent (2³=8 values)!\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Always group from RIGHT to LEFT\n• Memorize the 8 conversions (000-111 to 0-7)\n• Compare to hex: hex uses 4-bit groups, octal uses 3-bit groups\n• This is MUCH faster than converting to decimal first!"

Take the fractional part only\n2. Multiply by 2\n3. Write down the integer part (0 or 1)\n4. Keep the fractional remainder\n5. Repeat until remainder is 0 or desired precision\n6. Read the integer parts from TOP to BOTTOM\n\n**Example 1: Convert 0.625 to binary**\n\n0.625 × 2 = 1.25 → integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.25\n0.25 × 2 = 0.5 → integer part: **0**, remainder: 0.5\n0.5 × 2 = 1.0 → integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.0\n\nReading top to bottom: 0.101\nSo 0.625 in decimal = 0.101 in binary!\n\n**Example 2: Convert 0.75 to binary**\n\n0.75 × 2 = 1.5 → integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.5\n0.5 × 2 = 1.0 → integer part: **1**, remainder: 0.0\n\nResult: 0.11\nSo 0.75 in decimal = 0.11 in binary!\n\n**Example 3: Convert 2.75 to binary**\n\nHandle separately:\nWhole part: 2 = 10 (binary)\nFractional: 0.75 = 0.11 (binary)\nCombined: 10.11\n\n**Example 4: 0.1 (repeating binary)**\n\n0.1 × 2 = 0.2 → **0**, remainder: 0.2\n0.2 × 2 = 0.4 → **0**, remainder: 0.4\n0.4 × 2 = 0.8 → **0**, remainder: 0.8\n0.8 × 2 = 1.6 → **1**, remainder: 0.6\n0.6 × 2 = 1.2 → **1**, remainder: 0.2 (repeats!)\n\nResult: 0.00011001100... (infinite)\nThis is why 0.1 can't be exact in binary!\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Convert whole and fractional parts separately\n• Read bits from TOP to BOTTOM (opposite of whole number conversion!)\n• Stop when remainder is 0 or at desired precision\n• Some fractions will repeat infinitely"

But we can use binary as a bridge since both have clean relationships with binary.\n\n**The Binary Bridge Method:**\n\nOctal → Binary → Hex\n• Octal to Binary: each octal digit = 3 bits\n• Binary to Hex: group 4 bits = 1 hex digit\n• May need to regroup bits!\n\nHex → Binary → Octal\n• Hex to Binary: each hex digit = 4 bits\n• Binary to Octal: group 3 bits = 1 octal digit\n• May need to regroup bits!\n\n**Example 1: Convert octal 157 to hex**\n\nStep 1: Octal to Binary (3 bits each)\n• 1 = 001\n• 5 = 101\n• 7 = 111\nBinary: 001 101 111\n\nStep 2: Regroup for Hex (4 bits each)\nFrom right: 0 0110 1111\nPad: 0000 0110 1111\n\nStep 3: Binary to Hex\n• 0000 = 0\n• 0110 = 6\n• 1111 = F\nResult: 6F\n\nSo octal 157 = hex 6F!\n\n**Example 2: Convert hex 2F to octal**\n\nStep 1: Hex to Binary (4 bits each)\n• 2 = 0010\n• F = 1111\nBinary: 0010 1111\n\nStep 2: Regroup for Octal (3 bits each)\nFrom right: 010 111 1\nPad: 010 111 001 (wait, from right: 001 011 111)\nCorrect grouping: 000 101 111\n\nStep 3: Binary to Octal\n• 000 = 0\n• 101 = 5\n• 111 = 7\nResult: 057 (or just 57)\n\nSo hex 2F = octal 57!\n\n**Why No Direct Method?**\n• Octal uses 3-bit groups (base 8)\n• Hex uses 4-bit groups (base 16)\n• 3 and 4 don't divide evenly!\n• Binary is the common language\n\n**When to Use Each:**\n• **Hex**: Modern computing, web colors, memory addresses\n• **Octal**: Unix permissions, legacy systems\n• **Binary**: Low-level programming, understanding hardware\n• **Decimal**: Human-friendly, everyday use\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n• Always use binary as intermediate step\n• Be careful with bit grouping (3 vs 4)\n• Group from RIGHT to LEFT\n• Hex is more common today than octal"
