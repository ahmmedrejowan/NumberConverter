This elegant system allows both positive and negative numbers to be stored and manipulated using the same circuitry.\n\n**Sign-Magnitude vs Two's Complement:**\n• Sign-magnitude: Uses first bit for sign (0=positive, 1=negative)\n• Two's complement: More efficient, no separate +0 and -0\n\n**Two's Complement Method:**\n1. Write the positive number in binary\n2. Invert all bits (0→1, 1→0)\n3. Add 1 to the result\n\n**Example: -5 in 8-bit binary**\n• Start with +5: 00000101\n• Invert bits: 11111010\n• Add 1: 11111011\n• Result: -5 = 11111011\n\n**Key Properties:**\n• Most significant bit (MSB) indicates sign\n• MSB = 0: positive number\n• MSB = 1: negative number\n• Range for n bits: -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1\n• 8-bit range: -128 to +127"
