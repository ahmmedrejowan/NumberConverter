AND (&)** - Both bits must be 1\n• 0 AND 0 = 0\n• 0 AND 1 = 0\n• 1 AND 0 = 0\n• 1 AND 1 = 1\n\n**2. OR (|)** - At least one bit must be 1\n• 0 OR 0 = 0\n• 0 OR 1 = 1\n• 1 OR 0 = 1\n• 1 OR 1 = 1\n\n**3. XOR (^)** - Bits must be different\n• 0 XOR 0 = 0\n• 0 XOR 1 = 1\n• 1 XOR 0 = 1\n• 1 XOR 1 = 0\n\n**Think of it like switches:**\n• AND: Both switches must be ON\n• OR: At least one switch must be ON\n• XOR: Exactly one switch must be ON"
