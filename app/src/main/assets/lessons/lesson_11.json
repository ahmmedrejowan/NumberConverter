      "title": "What is Octal?",
      "content": "Octal is the base-8 number system, using only 8 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Notice that 8 and 9 are NOT used in octal!\n\nWhy is octal useful? Before hexadecimal became popular, octal was commonly used in early computing because it has a clean relationship with binary: each octal digit represents exactly 3 binary bits.\n\n**Place values in octal use powers of 8:**\n\u2022 8\u2070 = 1 (ones place)\n\u2022 8\u00b9 = 8 (eights place)\n\u2022 8\u00b2 = 64 (sixty-fours place)\n\u2022 8\u00b3 = 512 (five-hundred-twelves place)\n\n**Where is octal still used today?**\n\u2022 **Unix/Linux file permissions**: chmod 755 (rwxr-xr-x)\n\u2022 **Legacy systems**: Some older computer systems\n\u2022 **Educational purposes**: Learning number systems\n\n**Binary-to-Octal Relationship:**\nEach octal digit = 3 binary bits\n\u2022 0 = 000\n\u2022 1 = 001\n\u2022 2 = 010\n\u2022 3 = 011\n\u2022 4 = 100\n\u2022 5 = 101\n\u2022 6 = 110\n\u2022 7 = 111\n\n**Example: What is 25 in octal?**\n2 is in the 8s place: 2 \u00d7 8 = 16\n5 is in the 1s place: 5 \u00d7 1 = 5\nTotal: 16 + 5 = 21 in decimal\n\nOctal is less common than hexadecimal today, but understanding it helps you master number systems and is essential for working with Unix permissions!"
