      "content": "The decimal system (base 10) is what we use in everyday life. It's called 'base 10' because it uses 10 different digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\nEach position in a decimal number has a place value that's a power of 10:\n\n\u2022 Ones place (10\u2070 = 1)\n\u2022 Tens place (10\u00b9 = 10)\n\u2022 Hundreds place (10\u00b2 = 100)\n\u2022 Thousands place (10\u00b3 = 1000)\n\u2022 And so on...\n\nFor example, the number 3,425 means:\n3 \u00d7 1000 = 3000\n4 \u00d7 100 = 400\n2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n5 \u00d7 1 = 5\nTotal = 3,425\n\nThis is called 'positional notation' because the position of each digit determines its value. The same digit '2' means 2 in the ones place but 20 in the tens place!"
