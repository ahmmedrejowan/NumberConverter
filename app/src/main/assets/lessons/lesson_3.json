      "content": "Binary is the base-2 number system, using only two digits: 0 and 1. These digits are called 'bits' (binary digits). This system is perfect for computers because electrical circuits can easily represent two states: ON (1) or OFF (0).\n\nJust like decimal uses powers of 10, binary uses powers of 2:\n\n\u2022 2\u2070 = 1 (ones place)\n\u2022 2\u00b9 = 2 (twos place)\n\u2022 2\u00b2 = 4 (fours place)\n\u2022 2\u00b3 = 8 (eights place)\n\u2022 2\u2074 = 16 (sixteens place)\n\u2022 And so on...\n\nEach position's value doubles as you move left! Let's count in binary:\n0 = 0\n1 = 1\n10 = 2 (one 2, zero 1s)\n11 = 3 (one 2, one 1)\n100 = 4 (one 4, zero 2s, zero 1s)\n101 = 5 (one 4, zero 2s, one 1)\n110 = 6\n111 = 7\n1000 = 8\n\nNotice how we need more digits in binary to represent the same value as decimal? That's because we only have 2 digits to work with instead of 10!"
